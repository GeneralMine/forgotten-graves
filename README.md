# Forgotten Graves

Forgotten Graves is a fabric mod that stores items and XP inside an aging grave upon death.

I'm mostly working on this mod for my own server's personal use, and I'm new to modding, so I cannot promise that all requested functionality will be added (i.e. compatability with ___ mod).. but I'll still see what I can do with time.

With that being said, if you have any issues with the mod or a feature request, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/issues). Thank you! :)
