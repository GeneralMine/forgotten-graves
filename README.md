# Forgotten Graves

Forgotten Graves is a configurable fabric mod that stores items and XP inside a grave upon death; the grave will then begin to age between 4 different stages.

If you have any issues with the mod or a feature request, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/issues). Any feedback is welcomed. Thank you!

 

**Configuration Screen:**

*Note: Server-side configuration overrides any user set configuration currently. I plan to [change that](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/issues/13) soon, so that some of the settings are client-side only.*

 
## Want to help out?
I'm looking for someone who's good at creating block models and textures (as I'm not very good at it) for the biome specific model/texture feature; if that sounds like something you would like to do then please leave a comment on [this issue](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/issues/7). Thank you!

 
## Credits

This mod is heavily based on both [Graves Not Forgotten](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-forgotten) by `SilverGleam` and [Gravestones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gravestones) by `geometrically_`.

 
## Disclaimer

I'm mostly working on this mod for my own server's personal use, and I'm new to modding, so I cannot promise that all requested functionality will be added (i.e. compatibility with ___ mod). I'll still try though!

 
## Contributing

I still need to write up a contribution guide for this project; however, if you want to tackle one of the issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/issues) then please feel free to and send a pull request!
