## 1.19.2-3.2.0
### IMPORTANT
This update largely revolves around sprucing up the config. As such, it would be a good idea to reconfigure the mod (especially for servers).

### Added
- More experience settings, see [here]() for the new settings.
- More decay settings, see [here]() for the new settings.
- New `shiftSwapsDropType` option (default `true`). This options allows you to briefly switch between `DROP` and `EQUIP` by sneaking while retrieving graves.

### Updated
- Floating settings have been renamed to sink settings; i.e. floatInWater is now sinkInWater.
- `decayModifier` now defaults to `60`.
- `dropType`'s `INVENTORY` value has been renamed to `EQUIP`.
- Chat messages should now be formatted consistently.
