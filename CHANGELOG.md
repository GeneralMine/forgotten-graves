**Added**

- Graves are now backed up on the server, accessible even if the grave has already been claimed.

- Added four new commands to interact with grave backups: `players`, `list`, `restore`, and `delete`. You can read about them [here](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/wiki/Commands#grave-backup-commands).

- Added two new config settings for grave backups: `storedGravesAmount` and `destructiveDeleteCommand`. You can read about them [here](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/wiki/Config#stored-graves-amount).
